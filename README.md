<h1>Spell Help</h1>
<p>Designed to help players gain experience using keybinds for spells/abilities. </p>
<br>
<h3>Iteration 1 (MVP):</h3>
<ol>
<li>The user provides a list of abilities/spells. This is a text based list without pictures or context. </li>
<li>The user provides a list of keybinds that correspond to every ability/spell. Normal modifiers like shift/alt/ctrl will be ignored as keybinds by themselves. </li>
<li>When the user enters into a practice round, the abilities will be presented to the user. The user has 5 seconds to press the correct keybind.</li>
<li>Once a keybind is pressed, correct or not, the next ability will appear.</li>
<li>If correct, the counter will mark it, if wrong, the ability will be shown again after all spells have been shown.</li>
<li>A second chance will only occur once. Then the round is over.</li>
<li>A timer will also be going during the round to show how long it took to complete the round.</li>
<li>A performance screen will appear after the round is complete showing details from the round.</li>
<li>Percent correct on first attempt with actual numbers under, total time, what abilities were not complete even after the second attempt.</li>
<li>An option to try again or quit.</li>
<li>Ability/spell/keybind information stored in profile. Username and password protected.</li>
</ol>
<br>
<h3>Iteration 2:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Multi-character, multi-list, multi-keybinds. A profile will store a variety of options.</li>
<li>CSV uploads for ability/spell lists and keybinds</li>
<li>Expanded tooltip information. Individual spell countdowns, multiple uses before cooldown, etc.</li>
<li>Adjustable GCD. No longer a mandatory 5 seconds.</li>
<li>Performance information stored to profile.</li>
</ul>
